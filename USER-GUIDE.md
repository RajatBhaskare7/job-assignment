## Tips for Effective Career Counseling

### Be Specific

The more specific your questions, the more helpful the AI's responses will be. For example, instead of asking "What career should I choose?", try "I have a background in marketing and enjoy data analysis. What career paths combine these skills?"

### Provide Context

Provide relevant information about your background, skills, interests, and goals. This helps the AI provide more personalized advice.

### Ask Follow-up Questions

Don't hesitate to ask follow-up questions to explore topics in more depth. The AI maintains context within a session, so it can build on previous responses.

### Explore Different Perspectives

Ask the AI to provide different perspectives or alternatives. For example, "What are some alternative career paths I should consider?" or "What are the pros and cons of this career choice?"

## Example Questions

Here are some examples of questions you can ask the AI career counselor:

- "I'm currently working as a software developer but I'm interested in moving into product management. What skills should I develop?"
- "How can I improve my resume for marketing positions?"
- "I'm feeling stuck in my current role. How can I identify if it's time for a career change?"
- "What are the emerging career opportunities in the field of artificial intelligence?"
- "How can I prepare for a career transition from teaching to corporate training?"
- "What are effective strategies for networking in the healthcare industry?"
